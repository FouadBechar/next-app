          Most of the damage to our environment stems from consumption: what we
          consume, how much we consume and how often. Whether its gas,food,
          clothing, cars, furniture, water, toys, electronics, knick-knacks or
          other goods, we are all consumers. The key is not to stop consuming,
          but to start being mindful of our consumption habits and how each
          purchase or action affects the ecosystem. The good news is that its
          often not too difficult, expensive, or inconvenient to become more
          environmentally friendly. It can even be a fun challenge to implement
          among your family or coworkers. And though small changes at the
          individual level may seem trivial, just think how much cleaner the
          planet would be If everyone adopts behavior modification.

          Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are
          replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and
          wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being
          replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.
          Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are
          non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to
          form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful
          greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. Generating renewable
          energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels.
          Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the
          lions share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing
          the climate crisis. Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and
          generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.

          We are living in an era of contradictions. While we should focus on
          building a unified approach towards fighting a global pandemic, we are
          more divided than ever. We are more connected than ever before in
          human history, yet are unable to understand the plight of others. We
          see an evolution of human rights, but see no end to conflict. We are
          more willing to accept differences, yet discrimination is on the rise.
          We are living in an era where we have greater freedoms than ever
          before, yet we see no end to injustice. So where do we go from here?
          Is there a way to heal the world? Social justice may be the answer.

          Many children exposed to violence in the home are also victims of
          physical abuse.One: Children who witness domestic violence or are
          victims of abuse themselves are at serious risk for long-term physical
          and mental health problems.two: Children who witness violence between
          parents may also be at greater risk of being violent in their future
          relationships. If you are a parent who is experiencing abuse, it can
          be difficult to know how to protect your child.

          Children change rapidly as they grow. Many of these changes are
          physical. Other changes are cognitive, which means the changes affect
          the way children think and learn. Child development often occurs in
          stages, with the majority of children hitting specific developmental
          landmarks by the time they reach a certain age.

          You can promote good mental health by the things you say and do, and
          through the environment you create at home. You can also learn about
          the early signs of mental health problems and know where to go for
